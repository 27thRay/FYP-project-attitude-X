    Upload multiple files, consisting of one Job Description and several Resumes. 
    Evaluate each candidate against the job description using an AI-based algorithm 
    that matches and assesses candidates, assigning scores across various sectors,
    including Technical Skills, Soft Skills, and Language. 
    Candidates will be ranked based on these scores.
